# RSA Factoring:

RSA factoring is a cryptographic technique used to break RSA encryption by factoring the product of two large prime numbers. In RSA encryption, a public key is generated from the product of two primes, and the private key is derived from the factors of that product. RSA factoring involves finding these prime factors from the public key, which, if successful, compromises the security of the encryption.
